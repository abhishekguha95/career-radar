# Verification evidence

Record only commands actually run and observed results. Phase 1 implementation is in progress; completion is not yet claimed.

2026-10-21 environment checks: Node 24.3.0, npm 11.18.0, Docker 29.8.1, Compose 5.5.1. Docker daemon responds outside the sandbox. pnpm was absent initially; Python resolves to an unusable Windows alias; no host psql is installed. npm metadata/peer ranges were checked outside the network sandbox.

The original kickoff is user-provided and was untracked at the start. No existing application code or dependencies were present. Git uses a command-scoped safe.directory exception in the sandbox; global Git config was not changed.

## Increment 1: foundation

- `npm exec --yes --package=pnpm@12.14.0 -- pnpm install`: passed; pinned lockfile generated.
- Same pnpm prefix with `build`, `typecheck`, and `lint`: passed for the contracts workspace and foundation configuration. No application/unit tests exist yet.
- `docker compose config --quiet`: passed.
- `docker compose up -d --wait`: pulled postgres:18.6-alpine and reached healthy state.
- `docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U career_radar -d career_radar -c 'SELECT version();'`: PostgreSQL 18.6 returned.
- `git diff --check`: passed for tracked changes; new files reviewed before staging.
- Sandbox npm networking and Docker named-pipe access require escalation in this environment. These are execution-environment limits, not application failures.
